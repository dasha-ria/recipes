## Ingredients

- 350 g chicken
- 400 g noodles

* 1 carrot
* 300 g cabbage
* bean sprouts
* 7 cloves garlic
* 1.5 tbsp rice vinegar

## Instructions

Cut all the ingredients, and prepare the sauce.

Oil the wok and set it to a high temperature, wait until itâ€™s hot. Add the chicken (if you have 1kg, cook half of it at once) and cook until golden brown-ish.

Remove the chicken, add the garlic and spring onions, cook until golden brown. Add carrots, cook until soft, and then add cabbage.

Turn the heat down, add the chicken. Add bean sprouts, noodles, and mix a bit. Then add the sauce and repeatedly mix and toss until the noodles are glazed.
